Last Thursday we got into the car and drove down to the lovely [Noblessner ](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lore+Bistroo/@59.4526198,24.7308126,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xb25d590bc3af5ee5!8m2!3d59.4526198!4d24.7308126)in Tallinn. Its an old harbor district that has seen huge renovations done and looks spectacular, great for walks, events and indeed, restaurants. Since it was the early days of January, its was very dark and so the view didn't count for much however the pier was decorated with cool lights and when there isn't a strong wind, it is worth to take a walk either before or after the reservation.

We arrived around seven or eight, parked in the pay to park car park and looked for the Lore bistro. The entrance is smartly located on the opposite side of the car park area so guests have a view at the harbor and sea while entering/exiting and some window seats even when dining perhaps. (Although the windows are high up so you might not see out when you sit down at your table) The restaurant is in an old hangar type building which in the old times was used as a submarine construction/repair building. This means that the ceiling is very high and it feels huge. It's funny because while we were directed to our table I noticed that there wasn't much room. In fact I noticed quite few couple's tables (meaning two seats at a table). Most tables were long and seated multiple people. This makes sense when you read the introduction to the restaurant.

> Welcome to ‘LORE’, a community bistro in the heart of Kalamaja. This is a district well-known for local people making the most of their time with friends and family. Naturally, this often includes enjoying a delicious meal.
