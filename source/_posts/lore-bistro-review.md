Last Thursday we got into the car and drove down to the lovely [Noblessner ](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lore+Bistroo/@59.4526198,24.7308126,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xb25d590bc3af5ee5!8m2!3d59.4526198!4d24.7308126)in Tallinn. Its an old harbor district that has seen huge renovations done and looks spectacular, great for walks, events and indeed, restaurants. Since it was the early days of January, its was very dark and so the view didn't count for much however the pier was decorated with cool lights and when there isn't a strong wind, it is worth to take a walk either before or after the reservation.

We arrived around seven or eight, parked in the pay to park car park and looked for the Lore bistro. The entrance is smartly located on the opposite side of the car park area so guests have a view at the harbor and sea while entering/exiting and some window seats even when dining perhaps. (Although the windows are high up so you might not see out when you sit down at your table) The restaurant is in an old hangar type building which in the old times was used as a submarine construction/repair building. This means that the ceiling is very high and it feels huge. It's funny because while we were directed to our table I noticed that there wasn't much room. In fact I noticed quite few couple's tables (meaning two seats at a table). Most tables were long and seated multiple people. This makes sense when you read the introduction to the restaurant.

> Welcome to ‘LORE’, a community bistro in the heart of Kalamaja. This is a district well-known for local people making the most of their time with friends and family. Naturally, this often includes enjoying a delicious meal.

Wikipedia defines a bistro as:

> A bistro or bistrot /ˈbiːstroʊ/, is, in its original Parisian incarnation, a small restaurant, serving moderately priced simple meals in a modest setting with alcohol. Bistros are defined mostly by the foods they serve. French home-style cooking, and slow-cooked foods like cassoulet, a bean stew, are typical.\[1]

Lore Bistro makes it a point to mention how they adore food sharing and a communal eating experience. Rushing ahead I didn't notice this in any significant way, we were each served different dishes separately and we didn't have to share anything, thank Christ.

So let us continue, as we entered the huge doors to the Lore Bistro we were immediately welcomed by a huge curtain, similar to something you would see on the stage at a theater. It was clearly there to keep the warm in the restaurant since the doors were huge and opened basically right into the dining hall. The added benefit was that I could pretend to make a grand entrance, was fun. 

After having made a dramatic entrance by grandiosely revealing myself and my companion we were immediately greeted by the friendly people at Lore. Moments later we were taken to our table and provided with a menu. As I mentioned above tables are smallish but nothing uncomfortable, I'd say it was the standard size two seater. There was a live fire burning in the fireplace and the lighting was non-intrusive, bordering on cozy. Floors were all tiled, come to think of it I'm surprised I didn't observe any echo in there, but it was fine.
