Last Thursday we got into the car and drove down to the lovely [Noblessner ](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lore+Bistroo/@59.4526198,24.7308126,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xb25d590bc3af5ee5!8m2!3d59.4526198!4d24.7308126)in Tallinn. Its an old harbor district that has seen huge renovations done and looks spectacular, great for walks, events and indeed, restaurants. Since it was the early days of January, its was very dark and so the view didn't count for much however the pier was decorated with cool lights and when there isn't a strong wind, it is worth to take a walk either before or after the reservation.

We arrived around seven or eight, parked in the pay to park car park and looked for the Lore bistro. The entrance is smartly located on the opposite side of the car park area so guests have a view at the harbor and sea while entering/exiting and some window seats even when dining perhaps. (Although the windows are high up so you might not see out when you sit down at your table) The restaurant is in an old hangar type building which in the old times was used as a submarine construction/repair building. This means that the ceiling is very high and it feels huge. It's funny because while we were directed to our table I noticed that there wasn't much room. In fact I noticed quite few couple's tables (meaning two seats at a table). Most tables were long and seated multiple people. This makes sense when you read the introduction to the restaurant.

> Welcome to ‘LORE’, a community bistro in the heart of Kalamaja. This is a district well-known for local people making the most of their time with friends and family. Naturally, this often includes enjoying a delicious meal.

Wikipedia defines a bistro as:

> A bistro or bistrot /ˈbiːstroʊ/, is, in its original Parisian incarnation, a small restaurant, serving moderately priced simple meals in a modest setting with alcohol. Bistros are defined mostly by the foods they serve. French home-style cooking, and slow-cooked foods like cassoulet, a bean stew, are typical.\[1]

Lore Bistro makes it a point to mention how they adore food sharing and a communal eating experience. Rushing ahead I didn't notice this in any significant way, we were each served different dishes separately and we didn't have to share anything, thank Christ.

So let us continue, as we entered the huge doors to the Lore Bistro we were immediately welcomed by a huge curtain, similar to something you would see on the stage at a theater. It was clearly there to keep the warm in the restaurant since the doors were huge and opened basically right into the dining hall. The added benefit was that I could pretend to make a grand entrance, was fun. 

After having made a dramatic entrance by grandiosely revealing myself and my companion we were immediately greeted by the friendly people at Lore. Moments later we were taken to our table and provided with a menu. As I mentioned above tables are smallish but nothing uncomfortable, I'd say it was the standard size two seater. There was a live fire burning in the fireplace and the lighting was non-intrusive, bordering on cozy. Floors were all tiled, come to think of it I'm surprised I didn't observe any echo in there, but it was fine.

After getting our seats and been provided with a menu we were asked for our drink requests, we had a glass of white wine and a pitcher of water. It felt to the both of us that the wine poured out was very little in volume and didn't feel like enough. There was no complimentary or welcome snacks offered, not even (locally made)bread and butter. This was even more noticeable as I was very hungry and couldn't wait to order.

I had the scallops for my entrée and they were absolutely fresh and delicious. To this day I still remember the taste and the texture of those scallops, they were really impressive. The sauce around the scallops consisted of sourly and creamy tastes which complimented the delicate seafood very well. There were three scallops on the plate I was served and ample sauce around it. This is where I really wanted to have some bread or anything to scoop up the delicious sauce with but it was not to be. I did notice they offer the bread as a side dish or entrée in the menu though. But I noticed it only after I was knee deep in my scallops :P

For the main course I opted to stay on the seafood track and order a good old trout. Not really having any expectations to my choice. I was torn on the menu, usually I prefer a restaurant to have less items on the menu but made of high quality materials and held to a higher taste standard as opposed to a laundry list of dishes to order from with mediocre results. As I was picking and choosing my dinner though I felt like there maybe wasn't enough to pick from. This turned out to be an error in my head since the food was of high quality and the lack of choice in the menu a blessing.

The trout then. It was served once again on a plate surrounded with a sauce, still no bread. The trout was optimally cooked in most likely the absolute best way. It was lightly seared on one side so the skin of the trout was excellent and crunchy yet the fish was delicate and smooth. They even got the tastes inside of the fish, with each bite of the steaming delicate white fish I could experience all the different tastes packed within. I can not praise this trout enough, Lore bistro made this dish look easy and simple but taste-wise it's anything but.

Writing and reading this just made me hungry. Desert - I, of course, picked the chocolate cake, as you do. As I do in any restaurant that serves them, I'm a sucker for chocolate. Before I confirm my order though I specify with our server if the cake comes with a jam, as it usually does. Poured all over my lovely chocolate thus destroying the singular chocolate-y taste-  ok I'm in the minority here but I prefer my chocolate free of fruit, jam, ice cream etc. So I tell the lovely lady that if possible I'd prefer the jam separate from the cake - they accommodate my request perfectly by putting the jam in a small bowl next to the cake, this way I get to dose the jam-to-chocolate ratios. Guess what, that cake, best I've had in a long time. You would not believe how soft and chocolate-y it was. And I mean it tasted like I would want it to taste even though I have no idea how I want it to taste, you know. They know what I, as a chocolate cake fan, would love they (and by they I mean the Lore bistro chef) created the exact thing that I wanted at that moment. It was another dish that provided a taste experience to me.

Real talk kids, lets go over some other things:

* The actual dishes (plates, glasses etc) were nothing special, old to worn out even. E.g my water glass had marks from being in the dishwasher since the 70's
* There was a security camera staring in my face the whole time I was sitting at my table
* There wasn't exactly too much room and the table next door was quite close

But who the hell cares about this, when the food, you know the main thing you go to a bistro or restaurant for, is above and beyond expectations? 

Lets also look at the other side of the coin before I make my closing remarks:

* Service was with a smile the whole way, more than a smile, it was genuine and friendly
* Food arrived amazingly fast for each course
* Bathrooms were lovely
* Live fireplace
* Absolutely amazing tasting food

I think there is no competition, Lore is and should be a success. Totally deserved, hard work paying off, call mom and tell her you made it, internet reviewer approved, 100% success as a food serving establishment. I would wholeheartedly recommend their food. I will be going back and will always remember the chocolate cake I had at Lore bistro.
