This is a story about a personal struggle. I just had to start writing now cause it's day 3 now, its actually 12h into day 3 and the need for it feels like at its peak. At the very end of 2019 I came across a stupid health campaign by a ministry or something like that and they encouraged people to give IT up. Its a cheap, very small campaign, featuring two "celebrities" I half-know one of them I think, a TV host, have not heard about the other one. But it felt genuine and it was less intrusive and retarded than all the previous campaigns. And I have been feeling like I should give IT up about now. So everything aligned and I thought fine, I'll do it. Not just try but do. This stupid campaign can serve to be my motive.

So yesterday was day 2 and I did feel the need to pop out for IT and just do IT at maybe two separate occasions during the day. Felt strongly at the end of the day like I deserve one.

Today, its been on my mind since I got to work. After every piece of work I do, after every meeting I feel like damn, I could use one right about now. I know it's the addiction speaking and the fact that I have gotten used to doing it throughout the day and now suddenly I'm not doing it anymore.

I feel like the nerves in my body are quite highly strung, like I need to scratch my arm or my neck for no apparent reason. My legs twitch and are restless at some moments. It feels like a minute by minute struggle to not think about it. I fully acknowledge its the chemical substance you get from it that my body craves currently and I'm not giving it but its not just the substance, its the activity, its going outside and taking a breath, thinking, getting out of the churn for a second. I was never a social it-er, I preferred to take the time for myself, reflecting on the state of things, didn't like to talk to others while lighting IT.

I feel like yes I can do this, I can abstain from the unhealthy hobby, I can do it, but should I, why deny myself this thing? Who is really winning in this situation? Why is the health department running campaigns for me to stop doing this thing? What is their interest in this? Is it so that I would live longer, pay taxes longer? They dont care about the individual me? They don't even know I'm running with the campaign or using it as my motive. And they might never know they had a part in this. So who is benefiting the most from this. Yes of course its me as I'm getting a few years perhaps added to my total score.

But I liked doing it, at some point, I did like it. Then it became like a habit and had so many negative sides to it that you start to doubt in its effect and benefit. Then it becomes disgusting and you hate doing it and second-quess yourself about why you even doing it. Then you try to stop doing it and find out how much you think you like it still. I think that is the real golden truth about it - people who do it are never really at peace or happy, they think that doing it offers them relaxation or peace or whatever but the truth is that that is what people who don't do it, feel all the time. And people who do it just keep chasing that peace but they will never achieve it because they always need to do it.

The first commercial cigarettes were made in 1865 by Washington Duke on his 300-acre farm in Raleigh, North Carolina. His hand-rolled cigarettes were sold to soldiers at the end of the Civil War. It was not until James Bonsack invented the cigarette-making machine in 1881 that cigarette smoking became widespread.

So I know all of it, I have seen the images and heard the propaganda that doing it is bad for me, it stinks, it's barbarian and stupid. A person living in the 2020 should really not be doing a bad thing invented in the 1865. People did a lot of stupid shit back then. If anything there should be some cool futuristic new bad thing people could be doing but going with the belief that mankind can better itself and control its own destiny, then I think I can fucking give up doing it if I damn well want to. And I do want to not do it. When I do it I think I don't want to be doing it, when I try to stop I think I'd rather be doing it because what else is there left in life that is any good, well that is stupid, literally lots of good left in life and that is one of the very bad things that slowly but surely just kills you or reduces your quality of life. 

This is not a lecture or motivation for anyone to give, god knows most of the people have long already given up and the young'ns no longer do it, I think. Odds are no one reading this is struggling with this issue. But if you are, please don't take this as a suggestion to stop, I don't presume to tell you what to do, nor do I desire anything of the sort. You do you and nobody can control what you do. I hate when people preach or attempt to spread their grand good fortune on others, like omg you are healthy, congratulations but shut up, I know I could be healthy and work out more, god. I believe eating carrots and celery is the bees knees but did I ask? I know believing in Buddha or your God is really really awesome but again, did I ask, I know I should be doing this and that with my car to make it more cooler or faster, I know I should do that thing that is very beneficial for me but most of the time I just want to be left alone and not be judged or advised so much. Do I look like I really need all this free advice all the time, its like people have nothing else to talk about? Shit son, what do you think of that thing that guy wrote in the papers this morning, what do you think of Kandinsky in general or The Scream, what does it make you feel. Lets change the narrative sometimes.
