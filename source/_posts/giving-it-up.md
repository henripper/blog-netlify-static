This is a story about a personal struggle. I just had to start writing now cause it's day 3 now, its actually 12h into day 3 and the need for it feels like is at its peak. At the very end of 2019 I came across a stupid health campaign by a ministry or something like that and they encouraged people to give IT up. Its a cheap, very small campaign, featuring two "celebrities" I half-know one of them I think, a TV host, have not heard about the other one. But it felt genuine and it was less intrusive and retarded than all the previous campaigns. AND I have been feeling like I should give IT up about now. So everything aligned and I thought fine, I'll do it. Not just try but do. This stupid campaign can serve to be my motive.

So yesterday was day 2 and I did feel the need to pop out for IT and just do IT at maybe two separate occasions during the day. Felt strongly at the end of the day like I deserve one.

Today, its been on my mind since I got to work. After every piece of work I do, after every meeting I feel like damn, I could use one right about now. I know it's the addiction speaking and the fact that I have gotten used to doing it throughout the day and now suddenly I'm not doing it anymore.

I feel like the nerves in my body are quite highly strung, like I need to scratch my arm or my neck for no apparent reason. My legs twitch and are restless at some moments. It feels like a minute by minute struggle to not think about it. Like I fully acknowledge its the chemical substance you get from it that my body craves currently and I'm not giving it but its not just the substance, its the activity, its going outside and taking a breather, thinking, getting out of the churn for a second. I was never a social IT-er, I preferred to take the time for myself, reflecting on the state of things, didn't like to talk to others while lighting IT.

I feel like yes I can do this, I can abstain from the unhealthy hobby, I can do it, but should I, why deny myself this thing? Who is really winning in this situation? Why is the health department running campaigns for me to stop doing this thing? What is their interest in this? Is it so that I would live longer, pay taxes longer? They dont care about the individual me? They dont even know I'm running with the campaign or using it as my motive. And they might never know they had a part in this. So who is benefiting the most from this. Yes of course its me as I'm getting a few years perhaps added to my total score. 

But I liked doing it, at some point, I did like it. Then it became like a habit and had so many negative sides to it that you start to doubt in its effect and benefit. Then it becomes disgusting and you hate doing it and second-quess yourself about why you even doing it. Then you try to stop doing it and find out how much you think you like it still. I think that is the real golden truth about it - people who do it are never really at peace or happy, they think that doing it offers them relaxation or peace or whatever but the truth is that that is what people who dont do it, feel all the time. And people who do it just keep chasing that peace but they will never achieve it because they always need to do it.

So I know all of it, I have seen the images and heard the propaganda that doing it is bad for me, it stinks, it's barbarian and stupid. A person living in the 2020 should really not do
