# Hello World or hello the void

It's me, your favorite blogger and socialite! I'm baaaaaack with a brand new space. This time its a static site running on netlify using some pre-built assets by somebody, thank you somebody. 

Compared to mixedlives (my previous blogging experience) this is much more rugged and and less flashy. Thats because I'm doing everything (on backend and front) on my own, so progress will be slow, however, the most important part - posting blog posts and using gifs is already available, so no worries. I can post and in the mean time tinker away at making the blog a better experience for all of us.  As I'm writing this, on the last day of 2019 and sitting in the car service place, gettin' my oil changed, I feel like it's the perfect time to start a new blog and make the first post.

## So what can you expect on this blog here? 

I plan to share with you, dear reader, anything and everything worth a read. As the domain I'm going to use is going to be **primereview.eu** I will be conducting and writing reviews of various experiences and things, but mostly restaurants. I love dining out and I have had some wonderful evenings, brunches and lunches and I do want to share my thoughts on why some places exceed expectations and how they do it. I could also review any hotels I come across although nowadays I have not traveled as much as a couple of years ago so I will first have to cover the spa's and hotels here, in my neck of the woods, which is to say Estonia.

## When is this blog a go?

As with all new beginnings - this is it, now from the start of new year. Last time around I had a policy of having a new post at least once a week and I felt that balance worked quite well, I always had a post cooking and I didn't feel like I had to suck something out of the keyboard just to make my post quota. So here's hoping I stick to the same regime. I do have to develop the technical side of this blog as well in the mean time and I believe I'm going to work that into posts as well as I think some of you are also pondering blogging or are already doing it and would maybe want to be self-sufficient and not pay squarespace over a 100â‚¬ a year. Although, if you value time above all else and a really good blogging environment and great support then I would wholeheartedly recommend  Squarespace.
