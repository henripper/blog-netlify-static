..is easier than ever before. But not easy enough. My mother called me in the beginning of 2019, so about a year ago, and asked me how to set up a blog. She had googled around and stumbled on Weebly and that was too much for here. Weebly and Wix and the rest of them offer much more than a blog environment, they offer a website builder and a rather robust versions of it. But it's too much for a beginner like my mom. So I referred her to [medium.com](www.medium.com) where anyone can start a writing space in seconds or minutes. And they dont have to set up any pages or upload images for their website. 

I was agitated that my mom had so much trouble setting up a site and before we moved her to Medium I went in to Weebly to attempt to fix things up, it was horrendous. Turns out I wasn't Weebly savvy either and learning the quirks of that particular platform was more than I was willing to put up at that time. It got me thinking back to when I made a "serious" attempt at running a blog for a year. I used Squarespace at the time, because it was fast, easy and hassle free albeit hella expensive, well over ~100€ a year. 

At the end of 2019, I got the itch once more, to write, to continue my blog and I started shopping around for a new home. I did consider Squarespace once more but the price was definitely putting me off. It no longer felt like some 132€ a year was worth it to run a rather modest blog. I knew that if I was willing to put effort in I could run a blog for the price of the domain (some 8€ per year) or in the case of this year [Zone.ee](www.zone.ee) ran a promotion that offered .eu domains for 10 years for the price of 1 year. So yeah, that was a good deal. But the domain just just one, rather small part of a blog in technical terms.

One of the bigger issues was hosting. There are a lot of blogging platforms available that support custom domains and have good scalable hosting options. For example [Wordpress ](www.wordpress.com)- probably the biggest and most versatile option. I however wanted to be independent and I've grown to not like wordpress over the years. So I started courting [Netlifly ](https://www.netlify.com/) It is definitely a blogging platform though. Its much more than that. 

> "Netlify is everything you need to build fast, modern websites: continuous deployment, serverless functions, and so much more."

That is how they sell themselves. There is a free option for hosting your new fast, modern, continuously deployable and serverless function website, so it appealed  to me a lot. Not having to pay far out the ass for a blog that earns no revenue, was also appealing. But hosting is just half the battle. In fact it's the venue for the actual battle, you pick where you are going to start spilling blood and tears.

Next up is a CMS or content management system. A statically hosted website is all fine and dandy but I want to be able to post regular...posts..with images and links and stuff. Needless to say that having to create a new page each time I want to post something is not feasible, this has to be automatic. I found a template and CMS package that could presumably handle all this right on Netlify's site somewhere. The template, CMS that I got is all a skeleton in terms of features. It all does the very minimum needed for me to run this blog. It also came pre-baked with a comments engine.

For comments this site uses Disqus - which is named appropriately as it's somewhat disqus_ting _to me. Its bloated, required a log-in and takes up unnecessary space. I want a quick, lightweight and easy to use commenting system, I have to look for one though. In the mean time Disqus will have to suffice. (Apprarantly there is a way to [NOT require log in](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717211-guest-commenting) for Disqus comments)

And that is all fine for now. I will continue to fight to add features as I need them and upgrade  the visual style of the blog. I'm still in the early steps of setting up the main functions of a blog, having not taken a single step towards a more aesthetically pleasing, visually stimulating blog environment here. I dread the step but it's a battle I have ahead of me.
